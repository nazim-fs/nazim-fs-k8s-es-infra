# Introduction:

This document outlines key decisions made during the design and implementation phases of the solution. Considerations were made to ensure a robust architecture with operational excellence across various dimensions:

- High Availability, Fault Tolerance & Resilience
- Security
- Storage
- Cost Efficiency & Management
- Disaster Recovery
- Monitoring & Observability

Below, we detail the necessary implementations to address each consideration effectively:


## High Availability, Fault Tolerance & Resilience::

- Deploying Elasticsearch in a StatefulSet with multiple replicas ensures high availability, allowing Kubernetes to manage pod rescheduling and maintain cluster stability during node failures.
- Health checks, including readiness and liveness probes, are configured to monitor pod health and automatically restart unresponsive instances, enhancing fault tolerance and resilience.
- Utilizing PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for persistent storage ensures data integrity and availability even during pod restarts or rescheduling, further enhancing fault tolerance and resilience.
- Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) ensure a minimum number of Elasticsearch pods are available during maintenance or disruption events, maintaining desired availability without incurring unnecessary costs.
- These configurations lay a robust foundation for a fault-tolerant and resilient Elasticsearch cluster in the Kubernetes environment.


## Security:

- Implemented network policies and RBAC configurations to control traffic to and from Elasticsearch pods within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Enhanced security by granting additional privileges to the default ServiceAccount through a ClusterRole, ensuring necessary permissions for Elasticsearch pods to interact with Kubernetes resources.
- Adhered to the principle of least privilege to minimize unauthorized access or misuse of resources within the Kubernetes cluster, contributing to a comprehensive security posture for the Elasticsearch deployment.


## Storage:

- Integrated PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) with the existing gp2 storage class provided by the Kubernetes cluster to dynamically provision AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, ensuring reliable and scalable storage for Elasticsearch data.
- Leveraged PVCs to provide persistent storage for Elasticsearch data, enhancing fault tolerance and resilience by ensuring data integrity and availability.
- Utilizing Kubernetes StorageClass and PVCs simplified storage management processes and improved operational efficiency, enabling seamless scaling and management of Elasticsearch storage resources.


## Cost Efficiency & Management:

- Configured Elasticsearch pods with appropriate resource requests and limits to optimize resource utilization within the constraints of the underlying EKS cluster, preventing resource wastage and ensuring efficient resource allocation.


## Disaster Recovery:

- Implemented shard replication in Elasticsearch to ensure data redundancy and resilience against node failures, maintaining multiple copies of data across the cluster for enhanced disaster recovery capabilities.


## Monitoring & Observability:

- Utilized Prometheus and Grafana within the cluster to monitor Elasticsearch functionality and performance effectively.


## Possible Future Improvements:

- Utilizing pod affinity, node affinity, and pod disruption budget for better scheduling.
- Enabling Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for communication between Elasticsearch nodes and clients to ensure data security in transit.
- Implementing snapshots and backups of Elasticsearch indices to an external storage solution for data durability and disaster recovery.
- Implementing horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to optimize resource usage and reduce costs.
- Deploying Elasticsearch clusters across different Kubernetes clusters or cloud providers for redundancy and availability.
- Implementing centralized logging using tools like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) or Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK stack) to collect, store, and analyze logs for enhanced monitoring and troubleshooting.

Each of these improvements addresses critical aspects of deploying Elasticsearch with Kubernetes, enhancing reliability, security, scalability, and manageability.
